# University-Letter-Management

## Problem Identified from students - Whenever a student faces any issues in university he is instructed to write a letter to solve that issue and get sign from the Head of the department or respective department and get a sign and college stamp on it.Why because it is a proof that the student has faced this issue in real time, Which is kept in their respective desk which is used as a proof for faculty to not to face any false aligation from their respective senior or head
## - Student should wait in for hours to get his sign or to get guidence on how to solve the issue
## - Waste of time ( ENd up wasting lot of time waiting for staff )
## - Roaming around the University to get sign, stamp from different departments ( Issues in universities are never done in one deaprtment, should go to respectivs deparments and sign from them )
## - A tone of paper proofs to be attached to it (After getting to meet him, he may say get these paper proofs zerox in that case we have to wait again for hours becuase he is solving other students problems)
## - No guarantee that the problem will be solved even we wait for hours (Let's say the letter you have given is still at his cabin, only becuase he has forgot to submit it to respective department)
## - Should wait for hours to get some guidence or suggestion from the HOD ( what if the hod has went to a meeting or may be present in some other cabin or class)
## - can't say that the respective department or staff may be present on that day ( what if the issue should be solved on that day and you got sign from 3 departments but the 4th department staff is not present on that day, in that case we should again go to the head and get his guidence)
## - Should submit that letter to different departments staff and get sign them as well ( what if the paper which contains the head sign and stamp get's lost somewhere then we again need to write letter and wait for hours to get sign from him )
## - No issue tracking facility ( It would be great if there a way to see issue like issue tracking )

## - Problem Identified from Faculty - Not able to solve all the students issues
## - Can't manage the student issues due to this sometimes the problems which shoulid be solved very quickly are not solved with immediate effect
#### -Example (Let's say the Time table for students is prepared which contains room number-521A and time 9:20 to 11;00 and students are following it but suddenly a problem arises that there is a lecture class going on for some other department It is a problem which should be solved with immediate effect but if it is not updated on time it may cause so many problems)
## - Have to attend so many meetings due to which, may not solve all the students issues
## - Time management if there are so many students waiting for him then it is a waste of time for him
## - Maynot be present at cabin because of meetings which last for hours, which is a headache for students and the HOD as well
## - Complaints from parents for not solving the issue on time
## - Not all things are done by HOD sometimes he should take permission from the VC(Vice chancellor)




# - Suggested Solution: A way to streamline this entire process in online way and if there are so many students then the work can be shared among faculty as well this way and student can submit letters to whatever faculty based on requirement and the faculty can view the issue can suggest proper solution for it




# - Impact: ### - Through this way we can solve all the mentioned issues of students even if there are so many students with different issues and update in real time rather than roaming around the college we can just upload it online and send it to whatever department we want to
### - Faculty can solve the issues without any problems
### - Can solve almost all the problems


Project Stage 1, Console based letter management - This project will be useful for the students and universitie faculty to solve the students isseus through the online letter management system in real time
